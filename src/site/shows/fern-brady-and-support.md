To begin our 2019 run at the lovely Abbey Theatre in St Albans, we're delighted to be able to bring you 4 more superb comedy acts.

Headlining this month will be the brilliant [Fern Brady](http://fernbrady.co.uk/). With many TV appearances to her name, such as Live From the Apollo (BBC 1), Live from the BBC (BBC2), 8 out of 10 Cats (C4) and Russell Howard’s Stand Up Central (Comedy Central), we can't wait to see her perform in our friendly and intimate venue.

Supported by yet more favorites of ours at Humdingers Comedy, Fern will be joined by Robin Morgan, Heidi Regan and Jon Long to make up a night of comedy that is not to be missed.

Tickets are £10 online (plus £1 booking fee), or £12 on the door (we have sold out on every gig so far, and expect this night to be popular too... so buy your tickets early!)
