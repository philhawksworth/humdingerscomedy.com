## VIVIENNE KAY

Home Counties girl Vivienne Kay has been performing stand up for four years and brings a delightful charm undercut by wit and cynicism to shows throughout the UK.

Don’t let her apparent virtue fool you. Described as having ‘funny bones’, she mixes an innocence with unexpected darkness in gag filled sets.

<div class="review">
  <p>Vivienne Kay has plenty to say ... think Joe Pasquale on helium ... a winning, slightly vulnerable persona</p>

## BEN COHEN

Ben Cohen performed for us when we were still Comedy in The Crown and we’re thrilled to be able to bring him back to Humdingers Comedy. He’s a regular at lots of comedy clubs up and down the country and has also performed across Europe. Ben’s laid back self deprecating and anecdotal style is always a big hit with audiences.

2019 saw Ben take his first show up to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and he’s planning to make his full hour debut next year.

FINALIST 2018 New Jewish Comedian of the Year.
