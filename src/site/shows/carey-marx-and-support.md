Fresh from our opening night in our new home at Abbey Theatre in St Albans with Ivo Graham, we are delighted to be able to announce another wonderful lineup of 4 more of our favourite comedy acts.

The superb [Carey Marx](https://www.careymarx.com/) will headline. A regular at London's Comedy Store and no stranger to TV appearances and touring international shows, Carey brings a relaxed yet confident performance style that we love. He'll not be alone. We are also lucky to have the brilliantly reviewed, and extremely funny [Jenny Collier](https://www.jennycolliercomedy.com/about.html) to open the show, and support from 2 more superb acts who we also think you'll love.

Tickets are £10 online, or £12 on the door (previous nights suggest we are unlikely to have tickets on the door... so buy your tickets early!)
