## About the Abbey Theatre

Built and run entirely by members, The Abbey Theatre is all about providing high-quality, affordable productions to the local community.  Theyâ€™ve been delighting audiences for the last fifty years, mostly through the work of their resident production company, the widely-acclaimed Company of Ten.

Humdingers Comedy is thrilled to join the fold and bring regular stand up comedy nights to this established and cherished venue.

Our new home will be in their Studio venue, which seats about 75 people and is generally used for more challenging, even experimental, theatre, and now stand up comedy!

More information about this lovely venue can be found on the [Abbey Theatre website](https://www.abbeytheatre.org.uk/).
